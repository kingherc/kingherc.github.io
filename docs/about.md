### Who am I

<div class="author__avatar"><img src="/assets/about/profilepic_150.jpg" alt="Iraklis Psaroudakis" itemprop="image"></div>

My name is Iraklis Psaroudakis and I'm also known as "kingherc" on the internet. It's a funny nickname I picked on as a kid for video games, and haven't changed it since! This is my personal website. It serves as my blog and a way to express myself. I hail from Greece. If you would like to know my formal background in a nutshell, here it follows.

> [Iraklis Psaroudakis](/about.html) is working remotely from Greece as a Principal Software Engineer at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/), focusing on the distributed scalability of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/). Previously, he was a Principal Member of Technical Staff at [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/) in Zürich, Switzerland, concentrating on parallel and distributed programming, and graph-based analytical & machine learning workloads, especially in financial crime & compliance applications. Prior to Oracle, he completed his Ph.D. at the [DIAS](http://dias.epfl.ch) lab of [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/) in Lausanne, focusing on scaling up highly concurrent analytical database workloads on multi-socket multi-core servers through (a) sharing data and work across concurrent queries, and (b) adaptive NUMA-aware data placement and task scheduling. During his Ph.D., he cooperated with the [SAP HANA](http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-26824) database team. Before his Ph.D., he completed his studies in Electrical & Computer Engineering at [NTUA](https://www.ntua.gr/) in Athens.
