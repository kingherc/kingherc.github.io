## Personal data collected

### Comments

Some pages show comments by embedding an associated <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/discussions">GitHub Discussion</a>. The discussions are under the <a href="https://github.com/kingherc/kingherc.github.io/discussions/categories/comments">the Comments category</a> of my github repository, and the association is through a part of each page's URL.

The embedding of the GitHub discussion is done through the <a href="https://giscus.app/">Giscus</a> GitHub app automatically. More information on Giscus's privacy policy can be found [here](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/blob/main/PRIVACY-POLICY.md). In order to make a comment, visitors need to be logged in to GitHub and authorize the Giscus app to post comments on the GitHub discussion on their behalf. The comments are stored in the GitHub discussion (by GitHub) indefinitely. Visitors logged in to GitHub should be able to manage their comments. More information on GitHub's privacy policy can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).
