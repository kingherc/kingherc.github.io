Pocket Image Editor is a free program for .NET Compact Framework devices (such as Windows Mobile 2003 smartphones and PocketPCs) and PCs. Its main function is image editing in general. This means: to manipulate image files, to draw on images, to transform them or to apply effects on them. A whole new program missing from our program libraries till now!

Some of its functions are:

  * Effects (Negative Colors, Black & White, Lightness).
  * File functions. Mini file browser included. Opening File supported. Saving File supported (.bmp). New Image supported. Importing image into current image supported.
  * Image Editing (Flipping, Resize, Paper Size).
  * Drawing(Line, Rectangle, Polygon,Text, Ellipse).
  * Undo (one level).
  * Making Selections: Select a region and edit it. Also supported are Copy, Paste and Fill (fill is not exactly the usual one. this function replaces pixels with the same color in the selected region with another color).
  * Comprehensive cursor-based GUI/interface.
  * Zoom.
  * Advanced Cursor movement (normal, accelerated and "paint when move"). Also, 4 cursor styles.
  * Auto-Loading (on start) and auto-save (on exit) options to the registry.
