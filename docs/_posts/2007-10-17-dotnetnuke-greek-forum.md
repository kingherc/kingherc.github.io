I've uploaded a greek language pack for the forum module of DNN. I look forward to any of your recommendations and corrections. You can find it in the <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> website by following the path Projects > Core -- Localization > Language Packs > Greek. There you can also find a very useful language pack for the core DNN developed by Angelos Xipolias. I also remind you that there is a greek translation for the WWStore module (the one on which the Store 2 core module will be based) at <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.fr/">DotNetNuke.fr</a>.
