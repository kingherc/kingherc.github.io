Welcome to my new personal website! This website will serve as my blog, an area to express myself and as a point of contact. You can find more about me, my work and view my CV by visiting the [About page](/about.html).

I recently changed web hosting. But I have kept my older posts, which roughly consist of the following time periods:

* Posts older than 2011 are from my Greek university times, when I was an active Microsoft Student Partner. A lot of these older posts are in greek, and contain presentations and material about Microsoft .NET and related technologies. 
* Posts between older than 2017 are from my Swiss PhD university times, with a lot of research in databases. 
* Since 2022, I have relocated to Greece.
